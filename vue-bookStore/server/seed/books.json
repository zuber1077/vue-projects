Nearly 200 years ago, Wordsworth and Coleridge started a revolution when they proclaimed their aim to write in ‘the language really used by men.’ Neither of them quite achieved that. In [this collection], Raymond Carver has. And it is terrifying.”\n—Robert Houston, The Nation\n“In Raymond Carver’s stories, it is dangerous even to speak. Conversation completes the damage people have already done to one another in silence. It is not safe to form a sentence or even to speak a name. To say ‘Duane’ or ‘Holly’ is to pronounce yet another doom. This is the fiction Carver writes, and I know of nothing stronger in its kind.”\n—Denis Donoghue\n”\n\nExcerpt From: Raymond Carver. “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.” iBooks. ",

The mattress was stripped and the candy-striped sheets lay beside two pillows on the chiffonier. Except for that, things looked much the way they had in the bedroom—nightstand and reading lamp on his side of the bed, nightstand and reading lamp on her side.\nHis side, her side.\nHe considered this as he sipped the whiskey.\nThe chiffonier stood a few feet from the foot of the bed. He had emptied the drawers into cartons that morning, and the cartons were in the living room. A portable heater was next to the chiffonier. A rattan chair with a decorator pillow stood at the foot of the bed. The buffed aluminum kitchen set took up a part of the driveway. A yellow muslin cloth, much too large, a gift, covered the table and hung down over the sides. A potted fern was on the table, along with a box of silverware and a record player, also gifts. A big console-model television set rested on a coffee table, and a few feet away from this stood a[…]”\n\nExcerpt From: Raymond Carver. “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.” iBooks. \n“And for the TV,” the boy said.\nThe boy pulled into the driveway and stopped in front of the kitchen table.\nThey got out of the car and began to examine things, the girl touching the muslin cloth, the boy plugging in the blender and turning the dial to MINCE, the girl picking up a chafing dish, the boy turning on the television set and making little adjustments.\nHe sat down on the sofa to watch. He lit a cigarette, looked around, flipped the match into the grass.\nThe girl sat on the bed. She pushed off her shoes and lay back. She thought she could see a star.\n“Come here, Jack. Try this bed. Bring one of those pillows,” she said.\n“How is it?” he said.\n“Try it,” she said.\nHe looked around. The house was dark.\n“I feel funny,” he said. “Better see if anybody’s home.”\nShe bounced on the bed.\n“Try it first,” she said.\nHe lay down on the bed and put the pillow under his head.\n“How does it feel?” she said.\n“It feels firm,” he said.\nShe turned on her side and put her hand to his face.\n“Kiss me,” she said.\n“Let’s[…]”\n\nExcerpt From: Raymond Carver. “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.” iBooks.
